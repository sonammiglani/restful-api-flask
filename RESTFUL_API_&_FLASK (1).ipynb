        "\n",
        "HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client‚Äôs request to indicate the result of the request. These codes are part of the HTTP protocol and help the client understand whether the request was successful, failed, or if there was an error.\n",

        "### Importance of HTTP Status Codes in Flask APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Flask API, HTTP status codes are essential because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Indicates the Result of the Request**:\n",
        "   - Status codes give clients (e.g., browsers or other services) an immediate understanding of whether the request was successful or if an issue occurred. This is crucial for ensuring that clients can handle errors or success appropriately.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Improves Error Handling**:\n",
        "   - By returning specific status codes, the API can communicate the exact issue (e.g., bad request, not found, unauthorized). This allows the client to react accordingly, such as prompting the user for authentication or showing a user-friendly error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Facilitates Client-Side Logic**:\n",
        "   - Status codes help the client decide what actions to take. For example, if a request returns a **201 Created**, the client can update its UI to reflect the creation of a new resource. If it receives a **401 Unauthorized**, the client might prompt the user to log in.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Helps with Debugging**:\n",
        "   - Developers can diagnose issues more easily by using status codes to understand what went wrong. If the server returns a **500 Internal Server Error**, the developer knows there is a problem on the server-side. On the other hand, a **400 Bad Request** indicates that something is wrong with the client's request.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Standardization**:\n",
        "   - HTTP status codes provide a standardized way of handling requests and responses. This means that developers from different teams or different companies can easily understand how to interact with the API.\n",

        "\n",
        " 1. **Use HTTPS**\n",
        "   - **Why**: Transmitting sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens) over HTTP is unsafe because data is not encrypted, and it can be intercepted.\n",
        "   - **How**: Use an SSL/TLS certificate to ensure communication happens over HTTPS.\n",
        "     - You can use tools like **Let's Encrypt** to get a free SSL certificate.\n",
        "     - In development, you can use `Flask-Talisman` to enforce HTTPS.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. **Authentication & Authorization**\n",
        "   - **Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication:\n",
        "     - With JWT, a token is sent by the client (often in headers) to authenticate API requests.\n",
        "     - Ensure that JWT tokens are signed securely and set an expiration time.\n",
        "\n",
